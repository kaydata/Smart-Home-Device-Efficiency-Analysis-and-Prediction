# Smart-Home-Device-Efficiency-Analysis-and-Prediction
## Overview
This project aims to analyze and predict the efficiency of smart home devices using a dataset containing information about device usage, energy consumption, user preferences, and other relevant features. The analysis includes data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), building and evaluating predictive models, and visualizing feature importance.

## Dataset
The dataset consists of the following features:

UserID: Unique identifier for each user.
DeviceType: Type of smart home device (e.g., Lights, Thermostat, Camera, Security System, Smart Speaker).
UsageHoursPerDay: Average hours per day the device is used.
EnergyConsumption: Daily energy consumption of the device (kWh).
UserPreferences: User preference for device usage (0 - Low, 1 - High).
MalfunctionIncidents: Number of malfunction incidents reported.
DeviceAgeMonths: Age of the device in months.
SmartHomeEfficiency: Efficiency status of the smart home device (0 - Inefficient, 1 - Efficient).
